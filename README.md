# Madek

Madek is a media archival, management and sharing system that can archive
video, audio and image files along with their metadata. The system crowdsources the chore of
retrieving and assigning metadata to the users themselves instead of putting all the burden
on the archival expert.


## Documentation and installation

The recommended way to install Madek is via the [Madek
Ansible-Setup Project](https://github.com/zhdk/madek-ansible-setup).

More details about installing and configuring Madek can be found on our
wiki on Github:
