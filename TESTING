= Testing policy for Madek =

== General policy ==

- A feature only counts as implemented when it has tests.

- Spec descriptions and feature files should describe what is actually
  going on in the test, so that we know what the test is for.

- If you touch it, test it: Whenever someone changes something that
  had no test before, that person needs to write a test for it.


== What to test ==

  1. On the model level:

     Test whether the model can be instantiated and persisted by a factory. 
     This also exercises all model validation code and before/after callbacks.

     Test whether the validations work ("should have a name").

     Test whether model methods perform what they are meant to.

  2. On the controller level:
       
     The controller's actions should be invoked.

     It should be verified that they set the right variables to the
     expected values.
     
  3. On the view level:

     We have no specific requirements for view tests.

  4. In the examples (the business view):

     Examples might call multiple different controllers to reach
     their goal. The examples contain the data they enter into the
     system as well as the expected outputs.

     Examples contain reasons why something happens in a certain way 
     according to the business rules.

== When to write tests ==

- When a controller method is changed or created.

- When a new model is created.

- When a model is changed.

- When a new bug is reported, a test involving data that triggers
  the bug is written, before fixing the bug. After the fix, the test
  should automatically be green.

- Examples are written at the start of a new iteration/feature.

- Examples must pass green at the end of an iteration, before merge to master.
